## The Motivation & idea 

 Well I am a student and I watch courses and videos in English, for example, Frontend Master courses. I know a little bit of English and I understand it somewhat, but sometimes there are words that I do not understand So That is why I came up with this idea: a browser extension that translates video subtitles into Kurdish helping me and others  understand the content subtitles more clearly

## Optional: Use Your Own Google API Key 🔑

Sometimes because of high usage maybe your IP might get temporarily blocked or banned from using Google's translation service

So To avoid this you can just use your own Google Translate API key **From google cloud console**

### How to Add Your API Key

1. Open the extension popup
2. Click on the **Settings** section
3. Enter your API key in the **Google API Key** input field
4. Click **Save** to store the key & You can delete it anytime using the **Delete** button

> **Note ⚠️:** This is optional The extension works without it unless your IP is rate-limited by Google
