## The Motivation & idea 

 Well I am a student and I watch courses and videos in English, for example, Front and Master courses. I know a little bit of English and I understand it somewhat, but sometimes there are words that I do not understand So That is why I came up with this idea: a browser extension that translates video subtitles into Kurdish helping me and others  understand the content subtitles more clearly
